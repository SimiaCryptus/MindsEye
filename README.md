## Features

* Java - Use Java 8+, Scala, or any other JVM language.

* Support for multiple GPUs and high performance math using native libraries including CuDNN, CUDA, and OpenCL.

* A highly modular optimization engine - It can be configured for many popular algorithms, or customized for optimization research. 

* A large and extensible component library with a focus on automated testing and documentation.

* Utilize server clusters with Apache Spark for data-parallel training.

* Built-in JSON serialization for all networks.

* Output Markdown or HTML Notebook-style reports for documentation and research.

* Directly regress input datasets - learning is not limited to network weights.
