# mindseye

An experimentation project dealing with neural networks and backpropigation techniques with the eventual goal of focusing on image processing tasks such as classification, autoencoders, and convolutional neural nets.

[Inspired by the recent work at Google.](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)

## Background

Comming soon. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)

## How To Run

This project is a standard maven project with minimal dependencies & complexity. The primary (functional) tests can be found in [TestNetworkUnit.java](https://github.com/acharneski/mindseye/blob/master/src/test/java/com/simiacryptus/mindseye/test/TestNetworkUnit.java)
